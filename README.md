# Fantasy AGE Character Sheet

## About
This is a quick and dirty app I whipped up to act as a character sheet
and character editor for Fantasy AGE by Green Ronin. It's a Svelte 3 +
Material Web Component application intended to be (mostly) WYSIWYG.

App triggered printing is currently broken in Firefox. No fix is planned. (See Quick and Dirty)
